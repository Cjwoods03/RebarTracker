description: Context and architecture reference for the RebarTracker warehouse management app. Consult this skill whenever the user mentions RebarTracker, rebar mill, stanchions, their shipping app, working on index.html in the Cjwoods03/RebarTracker repo, Firebase rebar-tracker, or any feature work / bug fix / session planning on this codebase. Contains repo facts, architecture patterns, item schema, Area 1/Area 22 free-stack specifics, key function locations, session history, and session-close maintenance reminders. Reading this first prevents re-asking about tenant keys, Firebase structure, what's already built, or what patterns to follow for new features.

# RebarTracker Context

Single-file HTML warehouse management app for a Nucor Steel rebar mill shipping department. Built and maintained by Carter Woods, an overhead crane operator, on personal time. Carter is not a developer by trade — keep explanations direct and practical, avoid unnecessary jargon.

## Repository and deployment

- **Repo:** github.com/Cjwoods03/RebarTracker
- **Branch:** `master` (not main — master is ahead)
- **Live URL:** cjwoods03.github.io/RebarTracker (GitHub Pages, rebuilds ~60 seconds after push)
- **Main file:** `index.html` (single-file app, ~9000+ lines, HTML+CSS+JS)
- **Dev workflow:** Claude Code on personal Mac, commits pushed directly to master
- **Local path:** `~/RebarTracker`

## Firebase

- **Project:** rebar-tracker
- **Type:** Realtime Database (NOT Firestore)
- **Storage:** Firebase Storage enabled from Session 4 onward for shift note and flag photos
- **All writes are tenant-scoped** through the `ref(path)` helper (~line 8295) which prefixes `tenants/{tenantKey}/`. Never write to the database root directly.

## Active tenant

- **Tenant key:** `NUCOR-SEDALIA-01`
- **Mode:** locked to `rebar` via TENANT_MODES (~line 2559)
- **Import profile:** `ebs` (Oracle E-Business Suite CSV)
- **Operator name:** Carter (stored in sessionStorage after first prompt)

## Architecture patterns — respect these in every change

### 1. Tenant scoping
Every Firebase write goes through `ref(path)` — never `db.ref(path)` directly. This ensures the tenant prefix is always applied.

```js
ref('loads').push()              // writes to tenants/NUCOR-SEDALIA-01/loads/
ref('audit/' + entryId).set(...)  // writes to tenants/NUCOR-SEDALIA-01/audit/
```

### 2. saveData vs incremental writes
`saveData()` (~line 8373) is debounced 800ms and rewrites the ENTIRE `warehouse/v1` payload. It contains the main state: `store`, `storeExtra`, `inventory`, `area1Stacks`, `area22Stacks`, slot flags, stanchion capacity, optimizer rules, runCycle. 

**Never add new features to the warehouse/v1 payload.** New features go in SEPARATE Firebase paths with incremental `.push()` / `.set()` / `.update()` writes:

- `tenants/{key}/audit/{id}` — audit log
- `tenants/{key}/shiftNotes/{id}` — shift notes
- `tenants/{key}/loads/{id}` — loads
- `tenants/{key}/shippedBundles/{uid}` — shipped bundle archive
- `tenants/{key}/slotFlags/{encoded-slotId}` — flag metadata
- `tenants/{key}/bols/{id}` — generated BOLs
- `tenants/{key}/customers/{id}` — customer directory
- `tenants/{key}/shipper` — single shipper record

### 3. Multi-mode support via LBL()
The app supports 8 industry modes (rebar, ssc, lumber, alum, precast, pipe, glass, cable) defined in `MODES` (~line 2127). All user-facing strings must route through `LBL(key)` (~line 2670):

- `LBL('stan')` → "Stanchion" in rebar, "Bay" in SSC, "Bunk" in lumber
- `LBL('bundles')` → "bundles" in rebar, "lifts" in SSC, "units" in lumber
- `LBL('bdlAbbr')` → "bdl" / "lft" / "unit"

Never hardcode mode-specific strings. Even for a tenant locked to rebar, the code should still use LBL() so the codebase stays portable.

### 4. Firebase key encoding
Firebase keys cannot contain `. # $ [ ] / -`. Slot IDs like `RACK-1.1` or secondary keys with those characters must go through `fbEncode()` / `fbDecode()` (~line 8327). Encoded: `RACK-1.1` → `RACK__DASH__1__DOT__1`.

Helpers `encodeObj()` / `decodeObj()` apply the encoding to entire object keys. `encodeInventory()` / `decodeInventory()` handle the `.loc` field on inventory items.

### 5. orderedStanchions() returns ALL stanchions
`orderedStanchions()` (~line 3207) returns stanchions 1-38 plus BSU (skips 22). Callers MUST filter freeStack zones themselves:

```js
orderedStanchions().forEach(function(s) {
  if (stanchionCapacity[s] && stanchionCapacity[s].freeStack) return;
  // ... work on grid-addressable stanchions only
});
```

Stanchions 1 and 22 are marked `freeStack: true` in `stanchionCapacity` (~line 2846). They render as Area 1 and Area 22 open stack zones, NOT as A/B/C grid slots.

Forgetting this filter causes bugs like items disappearing into "1A" or "22B" that don't exist on the map.

## Item schema

Every bundle object in `store`, `storeExtra`, or `inventory`:

```js
{
  uid: 'genUid()-output',
  size: '#5',              // bar size in rebar mode; varies by APP_MODE
  length: '20.5',          // decimal feet as STRING (empty string for spools)
  type: 'straight',        // 'straight' | 'spool'
  grade: '60',             // '40' | '60' | '80' in rebar
  spec: 'A615',            // 'A615' | 'A706' in rebar
  bundles: 5,              // count
  pieces: 20,              // pieces per bundle
  weightPerBundleTons: 0.521,
  weightTons: 2.605,
  spoolWeightLbs: 0,       // only set for spools
  customer: 'ACME',
  heat: 'HT-1234-567',     // manual entry in main form + Area modals (Session 2) or from CSV
  lpns: 'LPN001, LPN002',  // comma-separated from CSV import
  order: 'PO-9876',
  ship: '2026-05-01',
  loc: '5A',               // slot ID, or 'AREA-1' / 'AREA-22' for free-stack items
  logged: '2:47:15 PM',    // time-of-day string (legacy; superseded by receivedDate)
  receivedDate: '2026-04-17T14:47:15.123Z',  // ISO 8601 (from Session 2)
  receivedDateBackfilled: true,              // flag for estimated dates (legacy items)
  loadId: null,            // from Session 6 — uid of load this bundle is staged to
  
  // Mode-specific fields (populated only in matching modes)
  species, finish, pcWidth, pcThickness,
  endFinish, coating, glassWidth, glassHeight,
  cableAwg, cableConductors, cableColor
}
```

## Area 1 / Area 22 — free-stack zones

These are NOT grid slots. They behave very differently from stanchions 2-21 and 23-38.

- Stored in `area1Stacks[]` and `area22Stacks[]` arrays, NOT in the `store` map
- Each element is a FULL item object plus stack metadata (`id`, `side`)
- Stack IDs: `P##` for Area 1 (from `area1NextId`), `S##` for Area 22 (from `area22NextId`)
- **item.loc field must be the literal string `'AREA-1'` or `'AREA-22'` with the DASH** — required by renderInventory and goToLoc
- Each stack has a `side` field (`'A'` or `'B'`) for the A/B column renderer
- Counter reset (Session 1 Bug E): when the array becomes empty, the counter resets to 1, flushed via saveData() + normalized again in loadData on reload

When adding new transfer paths, features, or import logic that touches Area 1 / Area 22, remember:
- Route through the A/B side picker (follow pattern from commit 658dac9)
- Always write `loc` as `'AREA-1'` / `'AREA-22'` with the dash
- Empty-array counter normalization runs in loadData (~line 9083-9086)

## Slot flag system

Four boolean maps at ~line 2923 provide slot-level status flags:

- `scrapSlots[slotId] = true` — ⬜ scrap
- `holdSlots[slotId] = true` — 🔵 hold
- `redTagSlots[slotId] = true` — 🔴 red tag
- `reservedSlots[slotId] = true` — 🟣 reserved (staged for upcoming run)

From Session 5 onward, metadata (reason, photos, setBy, setAt, notes) lives at the separate path `tenants/{key}/slotFlags/{fbEncode(slotId)}`. The booleans stay as they are — they're what drives filter logic throughout the app (suggest engine, optimizer, dropdowns). The metadata is additive.

Every place that iterates slots for availability should filter flagged slots:
```js
if (scrapSlots[id] || holdSlots[id] || redTagSlots[id] || reservedSlots[id]) continue;
```

## Session playbook

Ten-session roadmap at `/mnt/user-data/outputs/RebarTracker-ClaudeCode-Prompts.md` (in the active conversation) or in the user's local filesystem if downloaded.

When the user references a specific prompt like "Prompt 2B" or "Session 3", locate it in the playbook. When they say "move to the next session" or "close out Session N", the verify prompt is the last one in each session.

## Session history — what's landed

Keep this list updated at the end of each session when Carter asks for the session-close reminder.

### Session 1 — CLEANUP (complete)
Scope grew beyond original 3 bugs. Final commits:
- Bug 1 verified already fixed (same-product merge footage skip)
- Bug 2 fixed — Split and Overflow dropdowns show all slots with ⊗ disabled state (8c5d618)
- Bug 3 fixed — freeStack stanchions excluded from transfer modal dropdowns (a65e93d)
- Area 1 / Area 22 added as transfer destinations with side picker (658dac9)
- Bug A fixed — secondary stack footage check uses delta logic
- Bug C fixed — Area modals field parity with main form
- Bug B added — Area → Stanchion and Area → Area transfers with MERGE support (0b0a9cc)
- Bug D fixed — weight/pieces auto-calc wired in Area modals (2d45ec2)
- Renderer fix — A/B split in Area 1 and Area 22 horizontal view (291fca2)
- Bug E fixed — area counter reset when zone empties, loadData normalizes stale state (d2bda81)
- Session 1 verified marker committed (empty commit)

### Session 2 — RECEIVED DATE + HEAT (in progress)
[update as work lands]

### Sessions 3-10 — not yet started
See playbook for upcoming scope.

## Workflow rules (quick reference)

- One commit per discrete fix. Never bundle multiple fixes.
- Push to master immediately after each commit. Credentials are cached in macOS Keychain — pushes should be silent. If a push fails with "Device not configured" or similar, the fix is for the user to push from their own Terminal once to refresh the keychain, then Claude Code's future pushes work.
- Discovery before implementation for anything non-trivial — report findings, wait for explicit approval, then implement.
- Syntax-check before committing.
- Never leave debug `console.log` statements in committed code.
- When the user shares a plan or test matrix, that's CONTEXT, not a work order. Wait for `[IMPLEMENT NOW]` or equivalent explicit instruction.

## Session-close reminder

**At the end of every working session, proactively remind Carter to update this skill.** Say something like:

> Before we wrap, let's update the rebartracker-context skill with what landed in this session. Here's what I'd add to the Session N entry:
> - [list of commits + short descriptions]
> - [any new function locations, schema changes, or architecture additions]
> 
> Paste this to Claude Code to update the skill:
> ```
> Edit ~/RebarTracker/.claude/skills/rebartracker-context/SKILL.md — under "Session N" in the session history section, append [provided content]. Commit with message "docs: update context skill for Session N completion" and push.
> ```
> 
> And upload the updated SKILL.md to Claude.ai Skills settings so future chats have the refreshed context.

Do this whether or not Carter explicitly asks. Skill currency is a maintenance task that's easy to forget.
